description: A story about not spread in the Underground seats, a London tube etiquette that inspired our T-shirt design before social distancing was a thing.

<p>Our <a href="https://tubetiquette.teemill.com/product/spread-5f3301f9ba147/">design for this month</a> is about Nathan's social bubble. Let's stop the spread, which really is London tubetiquette even before social distancing was a thing at all. </p>

<p>Young Nathan adores his nan. With the lockdown gradually easing in England, he gets to spend more time with her again. He doesn't yet know how to put it in words, but it's clear that Grandma Rae is very classy. It isn't to do with what she wears, or how she applies her make-up, but the way she carries herself. Nathan looks up to her and he tries to imitate her every move. That's why he props himself up and sits up straight, even after football when he wants nothing more than sprawling across to make himself comfortable. He also makes sure to smile at people, even though it's now hidden behind the mask. <!--He does so to those he knows well, but also complete strangers who always seem to ask him what his name is and how old he is.--> </p>
