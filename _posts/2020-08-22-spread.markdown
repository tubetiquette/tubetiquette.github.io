description: A story about not spread in the Underground seats, a London tube etiquette that inspired our T-shirt design before social distancing was a thing.

<p>Another rule of London Tubetiquette! Our <a href="https://tubetiquette.teemill.com/product/spread-5f3301f9ba147/">design for this month</a> is for passengers lucky enough to have a seat. Some say this is no longer relevant, but we argue that it's conceptually similar to social distancing. Might be a bit of a stretch. Let's see...</p>

<p>Have you ever paid much attention to the fabric on the Tube seats? Not only is the moquette tough and durable, but it also keeps cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Now, have you realised that the seats are all divided up, really even those on the Bakerloo Line? Yes, that's so when you claim a seat, you know which space you get. Not half the space, not one and a half of the space, but one space, just like a typical board game, except that there isn't supposed to be winners and losers. </p>

<p>We know that cats stretch themselves out when they feel relaxed, but that's at the expense of us feeling threatened because we just can't read cats well and they might pounce on a prey any second. Let's just respect each other's personal space and keep our distance. We are not playing a strategic war game -- we're just trying to get to places. <!--If you want to read another story related to the Underground, <a href="{% post_url 2020-07-22-holdon %}">here</a>'s one. --></p>
