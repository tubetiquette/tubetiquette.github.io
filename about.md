<h1>Hi there</h1>

<p>We're Tubetiquette, and we're here to promote respectful living through a range of absurd t-shirt designs.</p>

<p>Our resident designer presents various breaches of social courtesy in the form of the most impenetrable creature on Earth. Whether aloof or misunderstood, cats appear oblivious to the people around them. There isn't any finger-pointing here -- mainly because we don't want to be hissed at -- but we do hope to encourage all tubeti-cats to show more consideration to other beings.</p>

<p>The illustrations are inspired by what we see and experience. As we're based in London, we can't help but make an inordinate amount of references to the weather, the Tube, and satire aimed at the absurdity of everyday life. Still, the events and characters depicted are purely fictitious, and any similarity to actual persons is entirely coincidental. </p> 

<p>No felines are harmed in the making of these t-shirts, and we try our best to limit our impact on the environment: all of our products are made from organic cotton in factories powered by renewable energy, and all purchases are shipped in plastic-free packaging. As part of the circular economy, the t-shirts are designed to be sent back and recycled when worn out, so that the materials can be kept in use for a long time, perhaps even longer than the reign of the Queen. </p>

<p>Our clothing brand was born in the summer of 2020, a time of self-isolation and mass demonstrations. We spent weeks reflecting on what made us human and how our society could function better. The answer we settled on was something we all learned as children years ago: each and every one of us carries a tremendous amount of value and should be treated with respect. That's everybody, including you and me, our nextdoor neighbours, and indeed, the nameless strangers on the Tube we may never meet again. </p> 

<p>Let's continue to be kind to our neighbours, look after our planet, and mind our Tubetiquette!</p>
