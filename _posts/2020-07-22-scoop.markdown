<p>Here's one of our two designs for the launch celebrating Pam and Jake's epiphany during the lockdown. <a href="https://tubetiquette.teemill.com/product/scooooop-/">Scoop</a> it out - it's ice cream tubetiquette!</p>

<p>The unseasonally warm weather here in the UK is luring Jake and Pam to get out of the house when they aren't supposed to, but nothing is stopping them from indulging in the classic summer treat, in a civilised manner. Going a few weeks back, they wouldn't pick up the mail for days at a time and would only get out of bed 5 minutes before their first video call of the day. But eventually Pam realised it'd gone too far, and Jake confessed it wasn't how he wanted to live either. Together, they had to set things right for the household. Now the pair of them change out of their pyjamas every morning, and they eat their ice cream out of bowls. Still, they're doing nothing about their hair that's getting way longer than they'd like, but really what could you do? </p>
