<p>We're Tubetiquette, and we're here to promote what we call respectful living through absurd, and sometimes humourous, t-shirt designs.</p>

<p>Our clothing brand was born in the strange times of self-isolation and mass demonstrations. Having reflected on what makes us human and how we can function better as a society, we hold that each person is valuable and should be treated as such. That's you and me, our loved ones with whom we share the ice cream, and indeed, the strangers on the Underground! </p>

<p>Ultimately, we hope to build a community that will help spread this philosophy, not by what they wear (though it'll help massively) but by how they go about their day-to-day lives. Realistically though, we'll be happy if our designs just get a conversation started.</p>

<p>The inspirations for our designs are drawn from what we see and experience. Since we're based in London, there may be an obsessive amount of references to the weather and the Tube, for which we can only apologise. Every month, our resident designer presents a breach of social courtesy in the form of a mischievous cat. Whether deliberate or accidental, we would simply like to remind all tubeti-cats to try to be more considerate to all those around them. </p>

<p>Our respect for each other extends to the environment: all of our products are made from organic cotton in renewable energy powered factories, and are shipped in plastic-free packaging. As part of the circular economy, they are designed to be sent back and recycled when worn out, so that the materials can be kept in use for a long long time. </p>

<p>We aim to bring about a positive impact, even if it's just to make you smile at our silly little shirts. Let's continue to be kind to our neighbours, look after our planet, and mind our Tubetiquette!</p>
