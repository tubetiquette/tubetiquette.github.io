description: Tubetiquette's t-shirt design illustrating the London Tube etiquette of not spreading out in the seats, which has been common courtesy before social distancing.
image-alt: A t-shirt with Tubetiquette's 'Spread' design, in the same red colour as the UK telephone box. The t-shirt features a white cat spreading across a few seats on the London Tube. 
description-short: Take a seat, and if you spread like a liquid, you might actually be a cat!

<p>Some say this rule of London Tube etiquette is no longer relevant, but we argue that it's conceptually similar to social distancing. Might be a bit of a stretch. We shall see... <a href="https://tubetiquette.teemill.com/product/spread-5f3301f9ba147/">This design</a> is for passengers lucky enough to have a seat. </p>

<p>Have you ever paid much attention to the fabric on the Tube seats? Not only is the moquette tough and durable, but it also keeps cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Now, have you realised that the seats are all divided up, really even those on the Bakerloo Line? Yes, that's so when you claim a seat, you know which space you get. Not half the space, not one and a half of the space, but one space, just like a typical board game, except that there should be no winners and losers here. </p>

<p>We know that cats stretch out to relax, but we should respect each other's personal space and keep our distance. Public transport is not the place for strategic war games -- we're just trying to get home to our couch where we can really spread out and get comfortable. <!--If you want to read another story related to the Underground, <a href="{% post_url 2020-07-22-holdon %}">here</a>'s one. --></p><br>
