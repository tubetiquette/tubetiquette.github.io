We're here to promite what we call respecful living through absurd, and sometimes humourous, t-shirt designs. Out brand was born in a strange time, during which we pondered over what made us human and what it meant to live in a society. The conclusion is that each person carries a huge amount of value and should be treated as such. That's everyone, including you and me, the stranger on the tube and our loved ones we share that tub of ice cream with. Ultimately, we hope to build a community that will help spread this philosophy, not by what they wear (though it'll help massively) but by how they go about their day-to-day lives. Realistically though, we'll be happy if we can just start a conversation about the situations depicted in our designs - yes, let's start with that. 

* Tubetiquette is a joke: like a lot of businesses, ours started off as a pipedream (get it?). We kept joking about it till it wasn't funny anymore, so we had to do something about it, aaand it's becoming funny again. 

* Tubetiquette is therapy: there's something about making light of a situation and laugh about it. Whatever you find frustrating, just replace it with a cat, the tubeti-cat!

* Tubetiquette is respectful living: that's the latter part of the word, leaving the other part up for interpretation, and sometimes down to imagination when we stretch it a bit too far...
