We can't assume that people around us want to tube-surf, so let's not lean against the poles... unless you're a cat. 

Now that Camilla is working from home, she is weirdly missing her commute. There were quite a few unspoken rules, and the first rule was to never speak to anyone on the journey. It was like playing a co-operative game in which passengers had to organise themselves around one another in the carriage and coordinate wrapping their palms atop each other up and down the poles, all without words or even eye contact. Very occasionally, there may be a cat wrapping its entire body around the pole, but cats are only small, so everybody else could still hold on and quietly cast their gaze onto their paper, their phone or a tube poster.

Inspired by the London tubetiqutte observed by Camilla, our brand is launching with [this design](https://tubetiquette.teemill.com/product/hold-on/) - the poles are made for holding.
